"""process.py

This module defines Pydantic models for the WS-BPEL 2.0 process definition. The process model is the top-level element in a BPEL document, defining the executable business process's flow, interactions, and behavior.

The models defined in this module include:
- BPELProcess: Represents the entire BPEL process, including its activities, partner links, variables, fault handlers, and more.
