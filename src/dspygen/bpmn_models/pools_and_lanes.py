"""This module defines Pydantic models for pools and lanes commonly used in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams.
Pools and lanes are used to visually organize and categorize elements within a BPMN diagram.

The models defined in this module include:
- Pool: Represents a pool in BPMN, which is a graphical container for grouping related elements within a BPMN diagram.
- Lane: Represents a lane in BPMN, which is a sub-division of a pool used to group and organize elements within a BPMN diagram.
