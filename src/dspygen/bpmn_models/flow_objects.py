"""This module defines Pydantic models for different types of flow objects commonly used in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams.
Flow objects represent work that is performed within a process and include tasks and subprocesses.

The flow object models defined in this module include:
- Task: Represents a task in BPMN, which is a unit of work that is performed within a process.
- SubProcess: Represents a subprocess in BPMN, which is a sequence of activities that is defined within a larger process.
